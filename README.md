This repository contains the complete analysis and final report for a Retail Sales & Customer Analytics Capstone Project, based on 10 months of real business data.
The goal of the project is to uncover insights about sales performance, customer behavior, category efficiency, discount patterns, and inventory management, using a data-driven analytical approach.

The project uses Python, Excel, SQL, and Power BI to clean, analyze, visualize, and present insights for strategic decision-making.

The objective is to identify:

* High-performing categories & brands

* Customer purchase behavior

* Inventory inefficiencies

* Discount optimization opportunities

* Drivers of revenue growth

* Churn and retention patterns

The analysis combines statistical, visual, and business intelligence techniques to produce actionable insights.

 Key Insights 

* One category contributes majority of revenue (showing dependency risk).

* A few brands dominate total sales volume.

* Several products remain dead stock, never sold in 10 months.

* Discounts >20% do not always lead to higher sales.

* Pareto rule confirmed: Top 20% customers generate ~80% of total revenue.

* Churn rises in later months due to long buying cycles & low repeat frequency.
